abstract = {Compared to typical visual person identification methods, person recognition through acoustic footsteps offers advantages such as fewer privacy concerns and contactless operation. Moreover, since acoustic footsteps are generated during walking, they inherently possess advantages in tasks like service robot following. Existing footstep classification methods still exhibit shortcomings in handling common interferences, such as clothing and shoe types. Moreover, the adverse impact of room types on footstep classification is highly prominent. These interferences pose significant obstacles to the implementation of acoustic footsteps-based person identification, thus necessitating urgent attention and resolution. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a Dominant Frequency Segmented Conformer with Domain Adaptation (DFSC-DA) for acoustic footstep-based person identification, aiming to enhance footstep recognition accuracy under various interferences. It divides the raw footsteps into multiple short-time sequences based on dominant frequencies, employs a Conformer to model intra-period variations and inter-period variations, and ultimately extracts favorable acoustic features for classification via an adversarial training mechanism. Experimental results on the AFPID-II acoustic footstep classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements in classification accuracy of 2.03 %, 6.66 %, and 3.50 % for the None, Clothing, and Shoe type conditions, respectively. Ablation studies conducted using a rigorous single-covariate controlled experimental protocol demonstrate that the DFSC-DA method achieves the highest scores across all settings.}
